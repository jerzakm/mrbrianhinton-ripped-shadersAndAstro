# MrBrianHinton project
aka I ripped [another developer's personal page](https://mrbrianhinton.com/) and lived to tell the tale.

I stumbled upon Brian's page after we exchanged a few words on Astro discord. I quickly noticed he was using pixi to render his cool animated background. Despite just being a small landing page with some text, it wasn't getting the best performance results from lighthouse due to heavy dependencies etc. I proceeded to do what any other sane person would, I ripped his page ðŸ˜† and added a pure webgl shader as a background (no library dependencies). Granted, it's different than what's on the actual site but I believe it fits the general style and works well as a proof of concept.
