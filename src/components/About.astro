# BRIAN HINTON
Designer leading teams that are creating good experiences for e-commerce content management, and building accessible interfaces. I aim to make digital products usable for everyone.

I’m the design manager at WebstaurantStore, where I spend my time coordinating the development of our platform’s design systems, leading the accessibility charge, and helping my team grow individually and as a group.

On the side, I’m a host on the show Thunder Nerds, a livestream and podcast where we interview people from all aspects of technology to find out their stories, and to share their life lessons with others. I also run Friends of Figma, Tampa Bay where I help connect Figma users in the area and around the world.
